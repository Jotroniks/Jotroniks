## Hi there, my name is Joshua Okpare, aka Jotroniks
- I am one with an interest in embedded systems, automation and AI.
- I recently worked on a deep learning project for classifying currency as genuine or counterfeit(focused on the Nigerian Naira).
I’m currently learning about communication protocols, using KiCad for PCB design, and collaborating on a computerised shoe polishing machine.
- I’m looking to collaborate on works relating to the embedded systems field, automation and application of AI
- Feel free to check out various other projects I've worked on https://github.com/Jotroniks
