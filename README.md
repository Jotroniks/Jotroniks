## Hi there My name is Joshua Okpare aka Jotroniks
I am one with interest in Embedded systems, automation and AI.
I recently worked on a deep learning project for classifying currency as genuine or counterfeit(focused on the Nigerian Naira).
I’m currently learning about communication protocols and the use of Kicad for PCB design
I’m looking to collaborate on works relating to the embedded systems field, automation and application of AI
Feel free to check out various other projects I've worked on
